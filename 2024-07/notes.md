# July Notes

## Monday, 15

I decided to take two IELTS Reading mock test per day. The first test in 09:00 and the second in 14:00.
I will only take this test from Monday to Friday. My weekends is free for other activities.

In each weekday I will dedicate 1hour for reading in english in two blocks of 30min. The texts that I will read should be news, scientific articles, non-fiction and contents related to computation.
