# Notes from July, 2024

## Monday, 15

I decided to take two IELTS Reading mock tests per day. The first test is at 09:00 and the second is at 14:00. I will only take these tests from Monday to Friday. My weekends are free for other activities.

Each weekday, I will dedicate one hour to reading in English, divided into two 30-minute blocks. The texts that I will read should be news articles, scientific articles, non-fiction, and content related to computing.

Finally, I need a way to analyze my scores on the mock tests and the total amount of hours dedicated to studying. I think I can use a spreadsheet.

**Obs:** I use ChatGPT to correct my writings. The prompt is: please analyze my notes and suggest grammar corrections and explain what is wrong.
